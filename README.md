# Summary

Megalopolitan And Astute Design (M.A.A.D) City is a project that our team envisioned 
to simulate a futuristic smart city, a city in the future where the majority of modes 
of transportation are electric and humanity is sourcing most of its power from 
renewable resources. The goal of our project is to simulate the harvesting of 
power from renewable resources and get an approximate energy input from different 
renewables (solar, wind, water turbines) and an approximate size they would have 
to be in regard to support our simulated city of a specified size.
